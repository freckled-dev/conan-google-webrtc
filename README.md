instructions
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/windows_build_instructions.md

use the visual studio installer and install the “Desktop development with C++”
component and the “MFC/ATL support” sub-components.

The SDK Debugging Tools must also be installed. If the Windows 10 SDK was 
installed via the Visual Studio installer, then they can be installed by going
to: Control Panel → Programs → Programs and Features → 
Select the “Windows Software Development Kit” → Change → Change → 
Check “Debugging Tools For Windows” → Change.

create and set the environment variable: "DEPOT_TOOLS_WIN_TOOLCHAIN=1". Else it searches for vs2017 in googly style.

You must have the version 10.0.19041 or higher Windows 10 SDK installed. This can be installed separately or by checking the appropriate box in the Visual Studio Installer. or by https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/

disable Antimalware service

enable long paths https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/attributes.html#short-paths
by using the tool `Group Policy` then `Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Filesystem > Enable Win32 long paths`.
AND set it to msys git (git bash) `git config --system core.longpaths true`

use `cmd`. Everything else does not work. Including Power Shell.

because there's no pip, install conan by installer \
- [downloads](https://conan.io/downloads.html)
- [`conan-win-64_1_24_1.exe`](https://dl.bintray.com/conan/installers/conan-win-64_1_24_1.exe)

### notes on versions

### tips if there're errors

by default the conan script loads depot_tools. To do it manually:
download depot_tools. add it to the system environment.
ensure it's first in PATH so no other pyhton exe can be found before it. \
https://storage.googleapis.com/chrome-infra/depot_tools.zip
verify that python comes first from depot_tools by running
```bat
where python
where python3
```

```

# toolchains

for setting up the arm toolchains, first [enable `binfmt`](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/) by running
